                                We know that during COVID-19, a lot of folks around the city and state are feeling uneasy about
                                the future - we’re not sure what the future holds either.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                That said: we know that we love making sure you have the gear you need for your adventures, and
                                we’re going to keep doing that - with our team - until the city tells us we can’t.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                But as long as folks like yourself support small businesses around the city, then we’ll be here —
                                every day, making sure your orders arrive on time.
                            </p>
